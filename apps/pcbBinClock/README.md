Another binary watchface showing time in a geeky way. The time can be read in the following way:

- the LEDs have values (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 from right to left)
- the top row represents hours
- the bottom row represents minutes
- to read the time one has to add up the values of the "enlightened" LEDs
- the time on the left screenshots is
- the time on the right screenshots is
